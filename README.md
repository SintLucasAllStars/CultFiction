# CultFiction

Watch the following cult cinema scenes very carefully, chose one detail, ANY DETAIL big or small to make a micro-game or game  prototype out of.
The idea is to show off your programming skills, your creativity and your organizational/production/decision making  skills. Therefore you should try to balance your game on these grading criteria:

   * Code organisation and complexity - 25 points max
   * Creativity and concept - 25 points max
   * Visual quality - 20 points max
   * Overall game quality - 30 points max

## Grade ranges
   * (0 - 40) - Onvoldoende
   * (41 - 60) - Voldoende
   * (61 - 85) - Goed
   * (86 - 100) - Excelent

On the pull request description should be your name, a small text explaining what scene and the elements of the scene that inspired the game.

The deadline for the pull requests is the 20th of September 2019.


## Concept:
At the start of the game you spawn on a deserted island. You have to collect as many coconuts as posible in a set time. You can collect the coconuts by trowing stones at them, once they fall down you get a point. The stones needed can be found arround the island.
