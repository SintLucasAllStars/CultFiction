# CultFiction

Watch the following cult cinema scenes very carefully, chose one detail, ANY DETAIL big or small to make a micro-game or game  prototype out of.
The idea is to show off your programming skills, your creativity and your organizational/production/decision making  skills. Therefore you should try to balance your game on these grading criteria:

   * Code organisation and complexity - 25 points max
   * Creativity and concept - 25 points max
   * Visual quality - 20 points max
   * Overall game quality - 30 points max

## Grade ranges
   * (0 - 40) - Onvoldoende
   * (41 - 60) - Voldoende
   * (61 - 85) - Goed
   * (86 - 100) - Excelent
