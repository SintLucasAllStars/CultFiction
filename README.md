# Student's Info

## The Game

Under the APK folder you'll find my different versions, the current one (if you want to test) is MVP 1 (Minimum Viable Product).
Controls: Swipe the club away from the ball, then let go. This will add force to the ball object using the distance and direction.

## Choices and why

I'm using Android because I haven't seen other students go for that option, and I wanted to do something that stands out at least a little bit.

I've made the pixel-art myself, i've used the PSD's for the project so I could easily adjust on the fly.

The concept came from the "I Am Legend" scene where Will is golfing on top of an aircraft carrier. I've gone for this concept along with android and pixel art because I think it suits phones quite well, as a golfing "mini"-game lacks features to really enjoy it on the PC, but it's a great game to casually play a round or 3 on a mobile platform.

There's very little interesting code, most of it is just straight-to-the-point coding. Interesting things like OOP & Inheritance weren't really neccesary for this small project.

## What could have been better

Other than "everything", specific things are my use of .FindGameObjectWithTag. Finding game object by class is less heavy and skips the tag system, which makes it easy to mis-type certain things.

The level system is very basic, what I want to add in the future (after this project) is to make the level and unlock system so automated that all I have to do is paint a level, and have it then automatically be added to the level list. This makes for easy expansion of the product after (hypothetical) app release.

# CultFiction

Watch the following cult cinema scenes very carefully, chose one detail, ANY DETAIL big or small to make a micro-game or game  prototype out of.
The idea is to show off your programming skills, your creativity and your organizational/production/decision making  skills. Therefore you should try to balance your game on these grading criteria:

   * Code organisation and complexity - 25 points max
   * Creativity and concept - 25 points max
   * Visual quality - 20 points max
   * Overall game quality - 30 points max

## Grade ranges
   * (0 - 40) - Onvoldoende
   * (41 - 60) - Voldoende
   * (61 - 85) - Goed
   * (86 - 100) - Excelent

## Delivery:
You will deliver the assignment by forking this repository, developing the game on your fork and sending a pull request.
On the pull request description should be your name, a small text explaining what scene and the elements of the scene that inspired the game.

The deadline for the pull requests is the 20th of September 2019.
