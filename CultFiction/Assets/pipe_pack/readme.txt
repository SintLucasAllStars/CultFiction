Thank you for purchasing the Pipe Pack!

There are 3 types of pipe :

Pipes with caps on BOTH ends
Pipes With one cap on one end
Pipes with no caps

Each of these pipe types has 4 sizes:

Small
Medium
Large
Huge

 

Each is named accordingly, for example : p_medium_2_cap, simply means a medium sized pipe with 2 caps. 



-3 valve meshes are included, each with their own clean, worn and rusty textures.

-There are also 4 valve wheels, Red, Green, Blue, Rusty


-Each pipe is assigned by default the 'clean' texture. There are materials for 'Worn' and 'Rusty' pipes, which are easily applied to the pipes. 
 Each support also has these textures
 You can also change the color of the pipes changing the 'Main Color' value in the inspector view. 

- Each pipe texture has a normal map applied along with a specular map in the alpha channel of the .TIFF file.

-The pipes work best when rotated in angles of 30 degrees, this way the caps connect well with each other

-Connecting pipes is very easy with Unitys vertex snapping tool

-Source files in .max format are included in a .rar file, should you want to edit or make new pipes ! 


-There is a demo scene included to give you an idea of how they piece together
