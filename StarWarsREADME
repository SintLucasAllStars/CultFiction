Name: Daniel Rouschop Dror

I chose to go with the battle of Hoth from the star wars saga,
The battle of Hoth is one of my favorite scenes from the entire saga,
It's the moment where I first saw the beautiful AT-AT's.

For this project I wanted to make something that could simulate the battle.
I was thinking about a tower defense game, maybe a little bit like plats vs zombies.

This project I focused on something that I've struggled for quite some time,
and that Abstraction, Inheritance and Polymorphism.
I learned a ton from it, and know see all the benefits it could bring, I have turned to the light side of the force (hue hue)

*Things about the game you should know*:

    1 -> Push turret button to spawn turrets,
         after that you can move them around on the available player tiles.
         Press left mouse button to place the turret, right mouse button to delete

    2 -> The game ends when an AT-AT reached the turrets (Rebel Base)

    3 -> Try to survive as long as possible

    4 -> The game is not balanced yet!
