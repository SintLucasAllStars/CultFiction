My game is inspired by this scene:

In CastAway, the guy tries to open a coconut several ways. After successfully opening the coconuts he is really happy. So happy that he wants to start his own restaurant.
He can do this! But he does need your help. Manage the customers, arrange everything in the restaurant the way you want it. Be careful, though, do not let your customers
wait too long. They are very impatient volleyballs.
